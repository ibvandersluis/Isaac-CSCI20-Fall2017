/* ~~~~Stock Portfolio~~~~
   Uses a struct to hold a stock portfolio. It holds information about the
   stock's name, sector, current price, and number of shares owned.
   
   The sectors are codified with letters according to this system:
   A - Auto Companies
   C - Consumer Products
   F - Financial/Insurance
   I - Industrial
   T - Technology
