/*  This program is designed to generate an employee's weekly pay stub
    given certain variables:
        - employee name
        - hourly pay
        - hours worked
        - miles traveled
        - insurance cost
    Using this information, the program will deduct wages for health
    insurance, apply taxes at 17%, reimburse the employee for miles traveled,
    and output a pay stub.
