   ~~~~~~~~HI HO! CHERRY-O~~~~~~~~
   This program simulates the Hasbro game Hi Ho! Cherry-O. In this game, the user
   plays against the computer. Each player has a tree with the same random number
   of cherries on it. The players take turns; each turn they spin for a random
   event which alters the number of cherries on the tree. The first player to
   clear all cherries from their tree wins the game.
