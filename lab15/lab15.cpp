/*  ~~~~MAD LIBS~~~~
    This program has a pre-determined 'mad libs' template. The passage
    is from The Martian; words have been deleted from it, and the user
    will input their own words to fill those places. The result will be
    similar to the original passage, but with nonsensical insertions from
    an oblivious user.
